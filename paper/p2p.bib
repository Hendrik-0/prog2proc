  abstract = {Modern microprocessors require an immense investment of time and effort
  to create and verify, from the high level architectural design downwards.
  We are exploring ways to increase the productivity of design engineers
  by creating a domain specific language for specifying and simulating
  processor architectures. We believe that the structuring principles
  used in modern functional programming languages, such as static typing,
  parametric polymorphism, first class functions, and lazy evaluation
  provide a good formalism for such a domain specific language, and
  have made initial progress by creating a library on top of the functional
  language Haskell. We have specified the integer subset of an out
  of order, superscalar DLX microprocessor, with register renaming,
  a reorder buffer, a global reservation station, multiple execution
  units, and speculative branch execution. Two key abstractions of
  this library are the signal abstract data type (ADT), which models
  the simulation history of a wire, and the transaction ADT, which
  models the state of an entire instruction as it travels through the
  microprocessor},
